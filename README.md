If someone will find this useful, I will update this template with dark mode switcher
Let me know your feedback on this

Made with simple semantic HTML, CSS (variables) and JS (Sidebar as a component)

-------
##### Quick guide on how to use component :)
I have used simple web components No external JS at all
Check `components.js` you will find a snippet of HTML code in wrapped with some JS stuff

Update that [HTML code](https://prnt.sc/RxNZVdse-kOG) it will be updated everywhere that components is called

##### How call that component?
in HTML (on page) you just have to mention the custom name of that template `<component-name>`
`</component-name>`
