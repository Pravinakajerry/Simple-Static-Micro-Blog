                        If you feel like your designs are more like strung-together hacks, you’re on the right path.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you’re waiting on feedback from your creative director, don’t wait.
                        <br>Keep exploring other options. Move on to the next task. Never sit around.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you want to be a better designer, don’t study design books.
                        <br>Study sculpture. Study paintings. Study cars, watches, philosophers, movies, fiction, music, people. Study the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you feel annoyed with your project manager or account manager, become their friend. You’ll both be happier and better at your jobs because of it.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you're wondering if everyone in the room is bullshitting, they are.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you keep hitting a wall and don’t know how to go forward, don’t go forward at all. Go the opposite direction. Do something different and come back later.
                        <br>
                        <br>The door will open. If you’re discouraged by someone else’s success, or you worry that you’re not part of the design in-crowd, you’re spending too much time online.
                        <br>
                        <br>Sign out of Twitter and make something for yourself. The rest doesn’t matter.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you hate everything you’ve ever made, congrats. You’re a designer. If you feel like the design would be better if you had three more hours to spend on it, spend the three hours.
                        <br>
                        <br>Respect your time, your team’s and your client’s, but take the time you need to do the best job you can. If you're given a small task that nobody else wants to do, put everything you can into it.
                        <br>
                        <br>Even the small stuff can be a big opportunity, if you make it one. If you want to code, code. If you don’t want to code, don’t.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you see another designer or studio’s work and think you could have done better, maybe you could have.
                        <br>
                        <br>But you didn’t. If you feel one day that design is the best, most exciting, most luxurious job in the world – and the next day that you’ve been cursed to move boxes around with a mouse accomplishing nothing truly meaningful – then good.
                        <br>
                        <br>You’ve kept your edge.
                        <br>Sincerely,
                        <br>
                        <br>- A fellow designer
